Instead of picking the letters A, B, C... tell me what is printed on the 
screen, or which method is being called etc. Make sure your answers are 
correct. If you're confused, write the program & test it out. 

Format your homework properly so it's easy to read/find your answers for 
each part.


A
Dog d = new Dog();
System.out.println(d.call(3));

This prints "woof, woof, woof!" and the method being called is 
    public String call(int k){...}; in class Dog

B
Object c = new Cat();
System.out.println(c);

This prints "I'm a cat go away" and the method being called is  
    public String toString(){...}; in class Cat

C
Object v = new Pet();
System.out.println(v.call());
// THIS IS WRONG
This prints "!!!" and the method being called is
    public String call(){...}; in class Pet

D
Pet p = new Pet();
System.out.println(p);

This prints the memory location of the object p.

E
Pet q = new Dog();
System.out.println(q.call());

This prints "woof!" and the method being called is
    public String call(){...}; in class Dog

F
Cat t = new Cat();
System.out.println(t.toString("Come here, kitty"));

This prints "Come here, kitty? ... Don't waste my time"; and the method being called is
    public String toString(String b){...}; in class Cat

G
Cat u = new Cat();
System.out.println(u.call(3));

This gives you an error because Cat and Pet doesn't have a method for call that accepts parameters.

H
Dog e = new Dog();
System.out.println(e.feet());

This prints "four" and the method being called is
    public String feet(){...}; in class Pet

I
Pet r = new Dog();
System.out.println(r.call(3));

This // I DON'T KNOW
