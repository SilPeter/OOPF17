If I remember correctly, ObjectOutputStream is supposed to ignore 
transient and static vatiables. We verified that the transient values 
weren't written out to the file in our demonstration, but I couldn't 
get the static variable to behave properly. Figure out what the correct 
behavior is supposed to be for static vatiables, and then write a 
demonstration program that shows that behavior.
